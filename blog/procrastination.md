I've been thinking a lot about how I start new things but don't very often push through to finish them. I used to feel shitty about it. Now I'm fine; I know that eventually I'll get back to it.

Some time ago, I started writing about things and after few month I . Doubt, anxiety — life simply got in the way. Few years
later, I picked up coding, and I was worried it would go the way of my writing, but so far so good. Some days are slower than others yes, but it keeps me interested, and as a bonus: it seems I’m going back to writing again!

I’m not pretending to be good or anything, but it's nice to be able to dump some thoughts publicly in my little corner of the internet. Who knows, it might help you, who is reading this, feel a bit less shitty about yourself.
